The philosophy behind this project is to purpose an advanced Gentoo pure system, personnalized by me with some tweaks.
Currently, the project isn't available right now, because i'm still working on it and it isn't ready.

There is some specifics things to know about Orchid :

- As of now, it is not considered as an OS, it will be an enhanced stage4 archive with profile plasma actived by default. 
  So basically, it's a Gentoo customization.
- Based on Gentoo and 100% compatible.
- It's meant for advanced users, with an install process that is easier and faster than Gentoo itself.
- You can make use of my own mirror, with an auto import from Gentoo tree every 4 hours.
- It's a no gui installation, I wanted to keep install process staged.
- All Gentoo packages are available.
- Kernel is gentoo-kernel and always up-to-date. Follow current kernel (5.16.11 actually).
- New emerge alt : blossom.
- EIX by default.
- All X11, video drivers, french support and optionnal Firefox will be available by default.
- No systemd and no snap.
- Flatpak is more fonctionnal than overlays, in most cases.
- Still source-based.
